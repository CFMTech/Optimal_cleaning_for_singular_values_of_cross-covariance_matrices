# Optimal_cleaning_for_singular_values_of_cross-covariance_matrices

These are the python scripts that allow to generate the charts (and get the associated data) from paper "Optimal cleaning for singular values of cross-covariance matrices", by Florent Benaych-Georges, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Marc Potters (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05543) 

base_functions.py is imported in all other files: in their current form, the imports work if base_functions.py is in the same directory as the script where it is imported
